# 1\. Tonic, Subdominant, and Dominant Functions

In tonal music, the relationships between chords are crucial for creating musical structure and emotional impact. These relationships are often described in terms of harmonic functions, which can be broadly categorized as Tonic, Subdominant, and Dominant. These functions help to create a sense of movement, tension, and resolution.

## 

## 1.Tonic Function (I, vi)

The Tonic function represents stability, rest, and the "home" key. It's the point of arrival and resolution in a piece of music.

* **The Tonic (I) is the home chord:** In a given key, the I chord is the foundation. It provides a sense of completion and finality. Think of it as the musical equivalent of coming home after a journey.  
* **The vi chord (relative minor) also has a tonic-like quality:** While not as strong as the I chord, the vi chord shares two notes with the I chord and can act as a substitute or a weaker form of the tonic. It provides a different shade of the tonic color.  
* **In major keys: I (C major) feels restful and resolved:** For example, in the key of C major, the C major chord (C-E-G) serves as the tonic. It feels stable and like a point of arrival.  
* **In minor keys: i (A minor) is the primary tonic:** In the key of A minor, the A minor chord (A-C-E) is the tonic. It provides the same sense of stability and resolution, but with a minor tonality.

  **Examples of Tonic Function:**

* **I \- V \- I (C \- G \- C):** This is a simple progression that clearly demonstrates the tonic's role. The V chord (G) creates tension, and the return to I (C) provides resolution.  
* **I \- vi \- IV \- V (C \- Am \- F \- G):** This progression moves away from the tonic (to Am), but ultimately resolves back to it, showcasing the tonic's pull.

  ## 

  ## 2\. Subdominant Function (ii, IV)


  The Subdominant function acts as a transitional element, moving away from the tonic and preparing for the dominant. It introduces a sense of movement and often leads to a slight increase in tension.

* **The subdominant (IV and ii chords) create a transition:** These chords act as bridges between the stable tonic and the tense dominant. They provide harmonic movement and direction.  
* **The ii chord is minor in major keys:** In a major key, the ii chord is a minor chord. It can be used to create smoother transitions due to its shared tones with other chords.  
* **The IV chord is major:** In a major key, the IV chord is a major chord. It's often used to propel the progression forward and create a sense of movement.

  **Examples of Subdominant Function:**

* **I \- IV \- V \- I (C \- F \- G \- C):** This common progression demonstrates the subdominant's role. The IV chord (F) moves away from the tonic and leads to the dominant (G).  
* **ii \- V \- I (Dm \- G \- C):** This jazz turnaround shows the ii chord (Dm) functioning as a pre-dominant, leading smoothly to the dominant (G) and then the tonic (C).

  ## 3\. Dominant Function (V, vii°)


  The Dominant function is all about tension and the urge to resolve back to the tonic. It creates a feeling of anticipation and expectation.

* **The dominant (V) chord creates tension:** The V chord has a strong tendency to resolve to the I chord. This tension is what drives much of tonal music.  
* **The vii° (diminished) chord shares similar tension:** The vii° chord also has a dominant function due to its tritone interval. However, it's less commonly used in pop music.  
* **The V7 chord (dominant 7th) adds more tension:** By adding a 7th to the V chord, you introduce a tritone interval, which increases the tension and the desire for resolution.  
* **The V chord strongly wants to resolve to I because of the leading tone:** The leading tone (the 7th scale degree) in the V chord is just a half-step away from the tonic, creating a strong pull toward resolution.

  **Examples of Dominant Function:**

* **V \- I (G \- C):** This is a perfect authentic cadence, the strongest form of resolution. The V chord (G) resolves directly to the I chord (C).  
* **V7 \- I (G7 \- C):** This is also an authentic cadence, but with added tension due to the 7th in the G7 chord. It creates an even stronger resolution.

  **Putting It Together**


  These three functions (Tonic, Subdominant, and Dominant) work together to create musical phrases and progressions that feel coherent and meaningful.

1. **Tonic (I, vi): Stable:** These chords provide a sense of rest and resolution. They are the "home base" of the music.  
2. **Subdominant (IV, ii): Moving Away:** These chords create movement and transition, leading away from the tonic.  
3. **Dominant (V, vii°): Tension, Returning to Tonic:** These chords create tension and the strong desire to return to the tonic, providing resolution.

   **A classic T-S-D-T progression:**

* **C \- F \- G \- C (I \- IV \- V \- I):** This is a fundamental progression that demonstrates the interplay of Tonic, Subdominant, and Dominant functions. It's a common progression in many styles of music.  
* **C \- Am \- Dm \- G \- C (I \- vi \- ii \- V \- I):** This is a more advanced variation that includes the relative minor (vi) and the pre-dominant ii chord, creating a more complex and interesting progression. It's an example of a "circle of fifths" progression.

# 2\. Supertonic, Mediant, Submediant, and Leading Tone Functions

In **functional harmony**, each scale degree plays a distinct role in harmonic movement. While the **tonic (I), dominant (V), and subdominant (IV)** are the primary building blocks of progressions, the **supertonic (ii), mediant (iii), submediant (vi), and leading tone (vii°)** serve **specific harmonic and voice-leading functions** that enhance motion and variation in chord progressiom

## 1\. Supertonic (ii)

### **Definition:**

The **supertonic (ii)** is the **2nd scale degree** of a diatonic scale. It functions as a **pre-dominant chord**, meaning it leads toward the **dominant (V)**.

### **Key Features:**

* Built from the **2nd scale degree**.  
* **Usually a minor chord in major keys** (**ii**), but **diminished in minor keys** (**ii°**).  
* Often functions as a **passing chord** or a **preparation for the dominant (V or V7)**.

### **Function in Harmony:**

* Acts as a **pre-dominant**: moves smoothly to **V or V7**.  
* Often **substitutes for the IV chord** because both share similar tones.  
* In jazz and classical, ii is frequently extended as **ii7 (Dmin7 in C major)**.

### **Example in C Major:**

| Scale Degree | Chord | Function |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2nd | D Minor (D \- F \- A) | Pre-dominant |

### **Example Progression:**

* **C \- Dm \- G \- C** (**I \- ii \- V \- I**)

  * **Effect:** Creates **strong motion** towards V, increasing harmonic flow.  
* **C \- F \- G \- C** (**I \- IV \- V \- I**) → Can substitute **F (IV) with Dm (ii)**.

### 

### **Usage in Minor Keys:**

* In **A Minor**, ii is **B Diminished (B°)**, making it weaker than in major.  
* **Example**: **Am \- B° \- E \- Am (i \- ii° \- V \- i)** → Common in minor key cadences.

**Common Genre Use:** Classical, jazz, film music.

---

## **2\. Mediant (iii)**

### **Definition:**

The **mediant (iii)** is the **3rd scale degree** of a diatonic scale. It is an **intermediate chord** between tonic (I) and dominant (V) but has a **weaker function**.

### **Key Features:**

* Built from the **3rd scale degree**.  
* **Minor in major keys** (**iii**), **major in minor keys** (**III**).  
* **Shares two notes with the tonic (I)**, making it a common substitution for I.

### **Function in Harmony:**

* Used as a **weak tonic substitute**.  
* Can act as a **bridge between I and IV**.  
* Often used in **deceptive cadences**, where **V resolves to iii instead of I**.  
* **In minor keys**, III is **major (relative major of i)** and plays a **stronger role**.

### **Example in C Major:**

| Scale Degree | Chord | Function |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 3rd | E Minor (E \- G \- B) | Weak substitute for I |

### **Example Progression:**

* **C \- G \- Em \- Am (I \- V \- iii \- vi)**  
  * **Effect:** Sounds smoother and more introspective than **I \- V \- vi \- IV**.

### **Usage in Minor Keys:**

* In **A Minor**, III is **C Major**, which is **a stable alternative to i (A Minor)**.  
* **Example**: **Am \- C \- G \- Am (i \- III \- VII \- i)** → Used in modal progressions.

**Common Genre Use:** Pop ballads, classical, jazz reharmonization.

## **3\. Submediant (vi)**

### **Definition:**

The **submediant (vi)** is the **6th scale degree**, acting as the **relative minor of I** in major keys and **relative major of i** in minor keys.

### **Key Features:**

* Built from the **6th scale degree**.  
* **Minor in major keys** (**vi**), **major in minor keys** (**VI**).  
* Often substitutes **for I (Tonic)** because it shares **two common tones**.

### **Function in Harmony:**

* **Acts as a tonic substitute**, creating **plagal-style movement**.  
* Often used in **deceptive cadences**, replacing I.  
* Forms the **famous vi-IV-I-V** "pop progression."

### **Example in C Major:**

| Scale Degree | Chord | Function |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 6th | A Minor (A \- C \- E) | Relative minor of I |

### **Example Progression:**

* **C \- G \- Am \- F (I \- V \- vi \- IV)**

  * **Effect:** Creates **pop-style movement**, used in countless songs.  
* **C \- G \- Am \- G (I \- V \- vi \- V)**

  * **Effect:** Substitutes vi for I, **avoiding resolution**.

### **Usage in Minor Keys:**

* In **A Minor**, VI is **F Major**, which often **replaces i (A Minor)**.  
* **Example**: **Am \- F \- C \- G (i \- VI \- III \- VII)** → Used in rock and folk progressions.

**Common Genre Use:** Pop, classical, folk, jazz.

## **4\. Leading Tone (vii°)**

### **Definition:**

The **leading tone (vii°)** is the **7th scale degree** and is inherently **unstable**, always pulling towards the tonic (I).

### **Key Features:**

* Built from the **7th scale degree**.  
* **Always diminished (vii°) in major**.  
* **In minor keys**, it’s **vii° in harmonic minor** but **♭VII in natural minor**.  
* Contains a **tritone with the tonic**, which **creates strong resolution pressure**.

### **Function in Harmony:**

* **Strongest tension chord**, leading to I.  
* Forms **part of the dominant function (V7 contains vii° inside it)**.  
* Often replaced by **V for a stronger resolution**.

### **Example in C Major:**

| Scale Degree | Chord | Function |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 7th | B Diminished (B \- D \- F) | Leading to I (unstable) |

### **Example Progression:**

* **C \- G \- Bdim \- C (I \- V \- vii° \- I)**

  * **Effect:** Increases resolution power toward **C (tonic).**  
* **C \- E7 \- Am \- Bdim \- C (I \- V/vi \- vi \- vii° \- I)**

  * **Effect:** Uses **Bdim as a passing diminished chord**.

### **Usage in Minor Keys:**

* In **A Minor**, **vii° is G\#°** in harmonic minor.  
* **In natural minor, it is often replaced by ♭VII (G major instead of G\# diminished)**.  
* **Example**: **Am \- G \- F \- E (i \- ♭VII \- VI \- V)** (Used in rock and classical).

**Common Genre Use:** Classical cadences, jazz ii-V-I, blues.

# 

# 

# 4\. Cadences (Ending Progressions)

Cadences define the way a chord progression ends and play a crucial role in how final or open-ended a musical phrase feels.

#### **1\. Authentic Cadence (V \- I or V7 \- I)**

* The strongest resolution in tonal music.  
* The V chord creates maximum tension, which is fully resolved when it moves to I.  
* A perfect authentic cadence (PAC) occurs when both chords are in root position and the melody ends on the tonic.  
* An imperfect authentic cadence (IAC) happens if the melody ends on a note other than the tonic or if the V chord is not in root position.

Example:

* G → C (V \- I) → Very final resolution.  
* G7 → C (V7 \- I) → Stronger resolution due to added tritone.

#### **2\. Plagal Cadence (IV \- I)**

* Also called the "Amen" cadence because of its frequent use in hymns.  
* The IV chord doesn’t create as much tension as V but still provides a gentle resolution.  
* Sounds softer and is common in folk, classical, and gospel music.

Example:

* F → C (IV \- I) → Less dramatic resolution.

#### **3\. Half Cadence (Ends on V)**

* Leaves the music open-ended, creating expectation.  
* Often used at the end of phrases that will continue rather than conclude.  
* Common in classical and jazz compositions.

Example:

* C → G (I \- V) → Leaves tension.

#### **4\. Deceptive Cadence (V \- vi)**

* The V chord sets up an expected resolution to I, but instead moves to vi (relative minor).  
* Creates a sense of surprise or unexpected emotional shift.  
* Common in classical, film, and pop music.

Example:

* G → Am (V \- vi) → Unexpected resolution.

#### **5\. Phrygian Cadence (iv6 \- V)**

* Occurs in minor keys where the iv6 (minor subdominant in first inversion) moves to V.  
* Creates a Spanish or classical feel.

Example:

* Fmaj7 → E (iv6 \- V in A minor) → Typical in Baroque music.

  ### **Additional Cadences**

1. **Cadential 6/4:**  
   * **Roman Numerals:** I6/4 \- V \- I  
   * **Description:** A common progression where the I6/4 chord functions as a dominant preparation.  
2. **Evaded Cadence:**  
   * **Roman Numerals:** V \- V4/2 \- I6  
   * **Description:** The expected resolution to the tonic is evaded by moving to a different inversion.  
3. **Picardy Third:**  
   * **Roman Numerals:** V \- I (in minor, but the I chord is major)  
   * **Description:** A major chord is used as the final tonic in a piece that is otherwise in a minor key.  
4. **Tierce de Picardie:**  
   * **Roman Numerals:** V \- I (major tonic in a minor key)  
   * **Description:** Similar to Picardy Third, often used in Baroque music.  
5. **Double Cadence:**  
   * **Roman Numerals:** V \- IV \- I  
   * **Description:** Combines elements of both plagal and authentic cadences.  
6. **Interrupted Cadence:**  
   * **Roman Numerals:** V \- vi (or V \- IV)  
   * **Description:** The expected resolution to the tonic is interrupted by moving to a different chord.  
7. **Plagal Half Cadence:**  
   * **Roman Numerals:** IV \- V  
   * **Description:** Ends on the dominant chord, similar to a half cadence but starts with the subdominant.  
8. **Phrygian Cadence:**  
   * **Roman Numerals:** iv6 \- V (in minor)  
   * **Description:** Specific to the minor key, the iv6 chord progresses to the dominant, often found in Baroque music.  
9. **Lydian Cadence:**  
   * **Roman Numerals:** II \- I (in Lydian mode)  
   * **Description:** Progression in the Lydian mode, creating a bright and uplifting sound.  
10. **Mixolydian Cadence:**  
    * **Roman Numerals:** I \- bVII (in Mixolydian mode)  
    * **Description:** Cadence in Mixolydian mode, often found in rock and blues music.  
11. **Dorian Cadence:**  
    * **Roman Numerals:** i \- VII (in Dorian mode)  
    * **Description:** Progression in the Dorian mode, providing a minor yet brighter feel.  
*

### **Applications in Songwriting**

By understanding these functions and cadences, you can create chord progressions that guide the listener’s ear naturally.

For example:

A pop song might use: I \- IV \- V \- I (C \- F \- G \- C) for a strong resolution.  
A jazz tune might use: ii \- V \- I (Dm7 \- G7 \- Cmaj7) for a smoother harmonic movement.  
A moody progression might use: V \- vi (G \- Am) to create an unexpected emotional turn.

# 5\. Harmonic Transitions Between Song Sections

In songwriting, moving smoothly from one section to another is crucial for maintaining flow, contrast, and emotional impact. Below are **common harmonic methods** for transitions between **verse, pre-chorus, chorus, bridge, and outro**, along with example

## **1\. Verse → Chorus Transitions**

This is one of the most important transitions in a song. Typically, the chorus needs to feel **stronger**, **more open**, or **more resolved** compared to the verse. Here are some common ways to achieve this:

### **A. Dominant Approach (V → I)**

* **Method:** The verse ends on **V (dominant)** or **V7**, leading to I at the chorus.  
* **Effect:** Strong resolution and forward momentum.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of C Major: **Verse ends on G (V) → Chorus starts on C (I)**  
  * Song Example: *“Smells Like Teen Spirit”* (Nirvana) – Verse ends on F (IV), pre-chorus builds tension, and chorus lands on Bb (I).

---

### **B. Subdominant to Tonic (IV → I)**

* **Method:** The verse ends on **IV** (subdominant), leading into **I** in the chorus.  
* **Effect:** A softer yet satisfying resolution.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of G Major: **Verse ends on C (IV) → Chorus starts on G (I)**  
  * Song Example: *“Let It Be”* (The Beatles) – Verse alternates between I and IV, creating a natural transition into the chorus.

---

### **C. Relative Minor to Major Lift (vi → I)**

* **Method:** The verse is based around **vi (relative minor)**, and the chorus **jumps up to I**.  
* **Effect:** Creates an uplifting, brighter chorus effect.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of C Major: **Verse in A minor (vi) → Chorus lands on C Major (I)**  
  * Song Example: *“Someone Like You”* (Adele) – Verse in F\#m (vi), then moves to A major (I) in the chorus.

---

### **D. Pre-Chorus Tension (ii → V → I)**

* **Method:** The pre-chorus builds harmonic tension using ii → V before resolving to I at the chorus.  
* **Effect:** Smooth connection, with a sense of lift into the chorus.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of D Major: **Verse in D → Pre-Chorus uses E minor (ii) → A7 (V) → Chorus lands on D (I)**  
  * Song Example: *“Livin’ on a Prayer”* (Bon Jovi) – Builds a pre-chorus tension using ii-V before hitting the chorus.

---

## **2\. Chorus → Bridge Transitions**

The bridge often introduces a **harmonic contrast**, creating a **break** from the repetitive loop of the verse and chorus.

### **A. Modulation to a Distant Key**

* **Method:** The bridge moves to a **distant key**, often the **relative minor** or a key a **major third away**.  
* **Effect:** Creates a dramatic shift, increasing emotional impact.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of C Major: **Chorus in C → Bridge in A minor (vi) or E Major (♯III)**  
  * Song Example: *“Bohemian Rhapsody”* (Queen) – The bridge ("So you think you can stone me…") moves unexpectedly to a different tonal center.

---

### **B. Chromatic Pivot (♭VII or bVI)**

* **Method:** The chorus ends on a borrowed **♭VII (dominant substitute) or ♭VI**, leading into a fresh tonal area for the bridge.  
* **Effect:** A subtle, unexpected but smooth shift.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of A Major: **Chorus ends on G (♭VII) → Bridge moves to C Major (IV of IV)**  
  * Song Example: *“Creep”* (Radiohead) – The bridge transitions using borrowed chords.

---

### **C. Deceptive Cadence (V → vi instead of I)**

* **Method:** Instead of resolving V → I, the chorus **lands on vi (relative minor)** for the bridge.  
* **Effect:** Creates an introspective, melancholic contrast.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of G Major: **D (V) at the end of the chorus → Lands on Em (vi) for the bridge**  
  * Song Example: *“Hey Jude”* (The Beatles) – The bridge ("And anytime you feel the pain…") starts on **vi** instead of I.

---

## **3\. Bridge → Final Chorus Transitions**

After the bridge, many songs return to the chorus for a final, **lifted** statement. Here’s how:

### **A. Reharmonization of the I Chord**

* **Method:** The bridge **alters the harmonic function of the tonic** (e.g., turning I into iii or vi) before returning to the chorus.  
* **Effect:** Gives the chorus a fresh impact.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of G Major: **Bridge in E minor (vi) → Chorus starts on C (IV) instead of G (I)**  
  * Song Example: *“Fix You”* (Coldplay) – The final chorus is **harmonically lifted** by reharmonizing the returning I chord.

---

### **B. Modulation Up (Key Change)**

* **Method:** The bridge builds toward a **half-step or whole-step modulation** into the final chorus.  
* **Effect:** Creates a climactic, uplifting moment.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of G Major: **Bridge ends on D (V) → Chorus starts in A Major (a whole-step up)**  
  * Song Example: *“I Will Always Love You”* (Whitney Houston) – The final chorus **modulates up** for a soaring conclusion.

---

### **C. Extended Dominant (V Pedal Hold)**

* **Method:** The bridge **sustains V** (dominant chord) or cycles ii-V before resolving back to I.  
* **Effect:** A strong, tension-filled lead into the final chorus.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of C Major: **Bridge ends on G (V) → Held tension → Explosive return to C (I) in chorus**  
  * Song Example: *“Don’t Stop Believin’”* (Journey) – The bridge holds the **V chord (E)** before resolving to A (I) for the final chorus.

---

## **4\. Outro Transitions**

The outro serves to **close the song** in a satisfying way. Common methods include:

### **A. Plagal Cadence (IV → I)**

* **Method:** The song ends with a softer **IV → I** resolution.  
* **Effect:** A gospel-like, “amen” resolution.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of F Major: **Chorus ends on Bb (IV) → Outro resolves to F (I)**  
  * Song Example: *“Hey Jude”* (The Beatles) – Ends on a long IV → I vamp.

---

### **B. Fade-Out on a Repeating Loop**

* **Method:** A repeating **I-IV or I-V vamp** is played while volume fades.  
* **Effect:** Open-ended, dreamlike feel.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of C Major: **Chorus vamp of C \- F \- G \- C (I \- IV \- V \- I) repeats and fades out**  
  * Song Example: *“Purple Rain”* (Prince) – Ends on a **looped I-IV progression**.

---

### **C. Tierce de Picardie (Minor to Major I)**

* **Method:** A song in a minor key **ends on the major version of I** (Picardy Third).  
* **Effect:** Provides a hopeful or unexpected bright ending.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of A Minor: **Song in Am → Final chord is A Major**  
  * Song Example: *“A Day in the Life”* (The Beatles) – The final chord resolves with **a sudden major I**.

---

### **Conclusion**

Harmonic transitions shape the **emotional flow** of a song. Whether it’s **lifting into a chorus (V → I)**, creating a **contrast in the bridge (vi or modulation)**, or **closing with a subtle cadence (IV → I)**, these techniques help structure memorable songs. Experimenting with **deceptive cadences, borrowed chords, and modal shifts** can add uniqueness to your transitions while maintaining a **natural harmonic flow**.

# 6\. Overview of Diatonic Harmony, Functional Harmony, Modal Harmony, and Tonal Harmony

Each of these harmonic systems plays a key role in **music composition, analysis, and performance**. While they overlap in many ways, they serve different purposes in structuring music and guiding harmonic movement. Below is a **detailed breakdown** of each systemHarmonic systems play a pivotal role in shaping the structure and emotional depth of music. These systems provide a framework for composers to create melodies, harmonies, and chord progressions that resonate with listeners. They also offer a lens for analysts to dissect and understand the underlying structure of a musical piece. For performers, a deep understanding of harmonic systems can inform their interpretation and execution, allowing them to convey the intended emotional nuances of the music.

**Understanding Harmonic Systems**

* **Music Composition:** Harmonic systems serve as a toolbox for composers, offering a wide array of chords, scales, and progressions to craft their musical ideas. By understanding the relationships between different chords and how they function within a given system, composers can create music that is both cohesive and expressive.  
* **Music Analysis:** Harmonic analysis involves examining the harmonic structure of a piece of music, identifying the chords and chord progressions used, and understanding how they contribute to the overall musical effect. This analysis can reveal the composer's intentions, shed light on the historical context of the piece, and provide insights into the emotional and structural elements of the music.  
* **Music Performance:** A solid grasp of harmonic systems is crucial for musicians to interpret and perform a piece of music effectively. By understanding the harmonic context, performers can make informed decisions about phrasing, dynamics, and tempo, ensuring that their performance accurately reflects the composer's intentions and conveys the emotional essence of the music.  
* 

**The Interplay of Harmonic Systems**

While each harmonic system has its distinct characteristics, they often overlap and interact in various musical contexts. Composers may draw from multiple systems to create unique and innovative harmonic structures. By understanding the interplay between different harmonic systems, musicians can gain a deeper appreciation for the rich tapestry of musical expression.:

##  Diatonic Harmony (The Foundation of Western Music)

### **Definition:**

Diatonic harmony refers to **chords and melodies built from a single key or mode**, using only the **seven notes of the diatonic scale** (major or minor). It is the most **common harmonic structure** in Western music.

* Uses **seven diatonic scale degrees** (no chromatic alterations).  
* Chords are built from the **major or minor scale**.  
* Follows **standard voice-leading rules**.  
* Often found in **folk, classical, pop, and rock music**.

### **Diatonic Chords in Major & Minor Keys:**

| Degree | Major Key (C Major) | Minor Key (A Minor) | Function |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| I | C Major | A Minor | Tonic (Stable) |
| ii | D Minor | B Diminished | Pre-dominant |
| iii | E Minor | C Major | Mediant (Weak) |
| IV | F Major | D Minor | Prepares dominant |
| V | G Major | E Minor (or E Major in harmonic minor) | Dominant (Strong tension) |
| vi | A Minor | F Major | Relative minor/major |
| vii° | B Diminished | G Major | Leading tone (Unstable) |

### **Example Progression (Diatonic in C Major):**

**C \- Am \- F \- G (I \- vi \- IV \- V)**

* Uses **only diatonic chords** from C Major.  
* Creates **smooth, natural harmonic motion**.

**Effect**: **Predictable, familiar, and harmonically "clean".**

## ---

 Functional Harmony (Guiding Chord Progression Movement)

### **Definition:**

Functional harmony **assigns a role to each chord** within a key, explaining how it moves within progressions. It is **based on tension and resolution**, leading from instability to stability.

### **Three Core Functions:**

| Function | Chords | Role in Progression |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Tonic (T)** | I, vi | Provides stability, "home base" |
| **Pre-Dominant (PD)** | ii, IV | Leads toward the dominant, builds motion |
| **Dominant (D)** | V, vii° | Creates strong tension that resolves to tonic |

### **Example Progression (Functional in C Major):**

**C \- Dm \- G \- C (I \- ii \- V \- I)**

* **Dm (ii) moves to G (V)** → Creates motion.  
* **G (V) resolves to C (I)** → Strong harmonic closure.

**Effect**: **Tension-resolution cycle that makes progressions feel "directed".**

### **Secondary Dominants and Functional Expansion**

Functional harmony also includes **secondary dominants** (V of a chord other than I), which **strengthen motion**:

* **C \- E7 \- Am \- D7 \- G \- C (I \- V/vi \- vi \- V/V \- V \- I)**  
* **Effect**: **More tension and chromatic movement within the key.**  
* **Genre Use**: **Classical, jazz, film scoring, and complex songwriting.**

## ---

 **Modal Harmony (Color and Ambiguity)**

## **Definition:**

Modal harmony is based on **modes (Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, etc.)** rather than traditional **major-minor functional harmony**. It focuses on **color, static harmony, and non-traditional resolutions**.

### **Key Features:**

* **Lack of traditional V → I resolution.**  
* **Use of modal characteristic notes** (e.g., Dorian’s raised 6th, Mixolydian’s ♭7).  
* **Often centers around a single modal tonic rather than tonal function.**

### **Example Progressions in Different Modes:**

* **Dorian (Minor but Brighter)**: **Dm \- G \- C \- F (i \- IV \- VII \- III)**  
* **Phrygian (Spanish, Dark)**: **Em \- F \- G \- Em (i \- ♭II \- ♭III \- i)**  
* **Mixolydian (Bluesy, Rock-like)**: **G \- F \- C (I \- ♭VII \- IV)**  
* **Lydian (Dreamy, Floating)**: **C \- D \- G (I \- II \- V)**

**Effect**: **More open-ended and coloristic, avoids functional "pull”**

## **Tonal Harmony (Western Classical Foundation)**

### **Definition:**

Tonal harmony is the **overarching system of Western classical music**, built on **diatonic scales, functional harmony, and voice leading rules**. It governs **how chords progress and resolve**, ensuring **coherence and structural balance**.

### **Key Features:**

* **Major-Minor System**: Rooted in **tonic-dominant relationships**.  
* **Voice Leading Rules**: Ensures smooth motion between notes.  
* **Hierarchy of Tension**: Certain chords pull strongly toward resolution.  
* **Modulation**: Moving between keys within a piece.

### 

### 

### 

### 

### **Example: Classical Tonal Progression (Beethoven Style):**

**C \- Am \- Dm \- G7 \- C (I \- vi \- ii \- V7 \- I)**

* Establishes **tonic (C)**.  
* Moves through **pre-dominant (ii, vi)**.  
* Builds **dominant tension (G7 → C).**  
* **Effect:** **Strong sense of movement and resolution**

## 

## **Summary & Comparison**

| Harmony Type | Definition | Key Features | Common Use |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Diatonic Harmony** | Stays within a single key | No chromaticism, uses I-IV-V | Pop, folk, rock |
| **Functional Harmony** | Assigns roles to chords | Tonic → Pre-Dominant → Dominant → Tonic | Classical, jazz, structured compositions |
| **Modal Harmony** | Uses modal scales, avoids V-I | Centered on a mode, lacks strong pull | Jazz, folk, experimental rock |
| **Tonal Harmony** | Western classical harmony system | Major-minor, voice leading, cadences | Classical, orchestral, film music |

---

### **Final Thoughts**

* **Diatonic Harmony** \= **Basic building blocks**.  
* **Functional Harmony** \= **Guides tension and resolution**.  
* **Modal Harmony** \= **Color and ambiguity**.  
* **Tonal Harmony** \= **Western classical structure**.

# 7\. Understanding Modes

#### 

#### Modes are variations of the major scale, each with a unique flavor and characteristic intervals. They provide alternatives to the traditional major/minor system and are essential to understanding modal harmony.

#### 

#### **The 7 Modes**

1. **Ionian (Major Scale):**  
   * Scale Degrees: 1-2-3-4-5-6-7  
   * Formula: W-W-H-W-W-W-H (W \= Whole Step, H \= Half Step)  
   * Character: Bright, happy, stable.  
   * Chord Quality Pattern: Maj-min-min-Maj-Maj-min-dim  
2. **Dorian:**  
   * Scale Degrees: 1-2-♭3-4-5-6-♭7  
   * Formula: W-H-W-W-W-H-W  
   * Character: Minor with a raised 6th, slightly jazzy, melancholic but brighter than natural minor.  
   * Chord Quality Pattern: min-min-Maj-Maj-min-dim-Maj  
3. **Phrygian:**  
   * Scale Degrees: 1-♭2-♭3-4-5-♭6-♭7  
   * Formula: H-W-W-W-H-W-W  
   * Character: Dark, Spanish, exotic, with a flattened 2nd.  
   * Chord Quality Pattern: min-Maj-Maj-min-dim-Maj-min  
4. **Lydian:**  
   * Scale Degrees: 1-2-3-\#4-5-6-7  
   * Formula: W-W-W-H-W-W-H  
   * Character: Bright, airy, dreamy, with an augmented 4th.  
   * Chord Quality Pattern: Maj-Maj-min-dim-Maj-min-min  
5. **Mixolydian:**  
   * Scale Degrees: 1-2-3-4-5-6-♭7  
   * Formula: W-W-H-W-W-H-W  
   * Character: Dominant, bluesy, with a flattened 7th.  
   * Chord Quality Pattern: Maj-min-dim-Maj-min-Maj-min  
6. **Aeolian (Natural Minor):**  
   * Scale Degrees: 1-2-♭3-4-5-♭6-♭7  
   * Formula: W-H-W-W-H-W-W  
   * Character: Sad, dark, melancholic.  
   * Chord Quality Pattern: min-dim-Maj-min-min-Maj-Maj  
7. **Locrian:**  
   * Scale Degrees: 1-♭2-♭3-4-♭5-♭6-♭7  
   * Formula: H-W-W-H-W-W-W  
   * Character: Highly unstable, dissonant, with a diminished 5th.  
   * Chord Quality Pattern: dim-Maj-min-min-Maj-Maj-min

**Modes and Diatonic Harmony**

#### 

#### In diatonic harmony, we primarily focus on the Ionian (major) and Aeolian (minor) modes. The chords within a key are derived from these modes. However, understanding all seven modes allows us to:

* **Recognize Modal Borrowing:** Chords from other modes can be "borrowed" to add color and complexity to diatonic progressions (modal interchange).  
* **Analyze Modal Music:** Some music is based on modes other than major or minor, and understanding the scale degrees and chord qualities of each mode is crucial for analysis.  
* **Create Modal Progressions:** We can intentionally write music that emphasizes a particular mode's unique sound.

**Modes and Chord Progressions**

#### 

#### Each mode has a characteristic set of chords and typical progressions.

* **Ionian:** Follows standard major key progressions (I-IV-V).  
* **Dorian:** Often features i-IV-vii or i-ii-VII progressions, giving it a jazzy feel.  
* **Phrygian:** Frequently uses i-♭II progressions, creating a dark, exotic sound.  
* **Lydian:** May use I-II-V progressions, giving it a bright, open sound.  
* **Mixolydian:** Commonly uses I-♭VII-IV progressions, creating a bluesy, dominant feel.  
* **Aeolian:** Follows standard minor key progressions (i-iv-v).  
* **Locrian:** Due to its unstable nature, Locrian is less commonly used as a primary mode but can add a unique, dissonant flavor.

**Modal Harmony in Practice**

#### 

#### In modal harmony, the focus shifts from traditional tonic-dominant relationships to the unique characteristics of each mode.

* **Emphasis on Modal Tonic:** Instead of V-I resolutions, the focus is on returning to the tonic chord of the mode.  
* **Characteristic Intervals:** Each mode has a characteristic interval (e.g., the raised 6th in Dorian, the flattened 2nd in Phrygian) that defines its sound.  
* **Static Harmony:** Modal progressions often involve repeating a small set of chords, creating a static, atmospheric feel.

By understanding the seven modes and how they interact with diatonic and modal harmony, you can expand your musical vocabulary and create more diverse and interesting chord progressions.

#### 

#### **Common Borrowed Chords in Major Keys**

1. bIII (E♭ major in C major)  
   * Creates a dramatic, bluesy effect.  
   * Example: C \- E♭ \- F \- C  
2. iv (F minor in C major)  
   * Adds a melancholic, emotional shift.  
   * Example: C \- Fm \- G \- C (used in rock ballads).  
3. bVI (A♭ major in C major)  
   * Creates a surprising modal feel.  
   * Example: C \- A♭ \- F \- G (used in cinematic music).  
4. bVII (B♭ major in C major)  
   * Creates a dominant "Mixolydian" feel.  
   * Example: C \- Bb \- F \- C (common in rock and funk).  
5. V7 of V (Secondary Dominant \- D7 in C major)  
   * Temporarily tonicizes the V chord.  
   * Example: C \- D7 \- G \- C.  
6. Neapolitan Chord (bII \- D♭ major in C major)  
   * Common in classical music.  
   * Example: Db \- G \- C (iv6 \- V \- I).

     # 8\. Chromaticism & Non-Diatonic Chords

Chromaticism refers to using notes and chords outside the key to add tension, color, and movement.

#### **1\. Secondary Dominants (V of V, V of ii, etc.)**

* These are dominant chords that temporarily tonicize a non-tonic chord.  
* Written as V/x (dominant of another degree).  
* Example in C major: D7 (V7 of G) leads to G instead of just V.

#### **2\. Neapolitan Chord (bII)**

* A major chord built on the lowered second scale degree.  
* Typically appears in first inversion (bII6).  
* Common in classical and film music.

Example:

* Db (bII6) → G (V) → C (I)

Used in:

* Chopin, Beethoven, and dramatic film scores.

#### 

#### 

#### 

#### **3\. Augmented Sixth Chords**

* Used to create a strong pull to the dominant (V).  
* Common types:  
  * Italian: (b6, 1, \#4) → Ex: A♭ \- C \- F\# (resolves to G)  
  * French: (b6, 1, 2, \#4) → Ex: A♭ \- C \- D \- F\#  
  * German: (b6, 1, b3, \#4) → Ex: A♭ \- C \- E♭ \- F\#

Used in:

* Beethoven, Wagner, and jazz progressions.

#### **4\. Tritone Substitution**

* A dominant chord can be replaced with a dominant chord a tritone (3 whole steps) away.  
* Works because both chords share the same tritone interval.  
* Example: G7 → Db7 in C major.

Progression:

* C \- Db7 \- C instead of C \- G7 \- C.

Used in:

* Jazz and blues for smooth voice leading.

#### **5\. Chromatic Mediants**

* A mediant (iii or vi) that is altered chromatically.  
* Example: In C major, instead of E minor (iii), use E major.

Progression:

* C \- E \- F \- G (instead of C \- Em \- F \- G).

Used in:

* Romantic music (Chopin, Liszt, Rachmaninoff).  
* Modern film scores (Hans Zimmer, John Williams)

# 9\. Harmonic shifts 

While standard progressions (like V → I for a strong resolution) dominate pop and rock songwriting, many **uncommon transitions** can create unique, unexpected, or dramatic effects in a song. Below are **less common harmonic shifts**, their effects, and examples of how they have been used effectively.

## 

## 

## **1\. Parallel Mode Shift (Major ↔ Minor)**

* **Method:** A section shifts between the **parallel major and minor** (e.g., C major → C minor).  
* **Effect:** This creates a **sudden mood change**, either darkening or brightening the section.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of C Major: **Verse in C Major → Chorus in C Minor**  
  * Song Example: *“While My Guitar Gently Weeps”* (The Beatles)  
    * The verse is in **A minor**, but the chorus shifts to **A major**, giving an emotional lift.

---

## **2\. Common-Tone Modulation**

* **Method:** A section **modulates to an unexpected key** while maintaining a **common note** between the last chord of one section and the first chord of the next.  
* **Effect:** A **smooth yet surprising transition**, allowing harmonic motion without direct modulation.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of E Major: **Chorus ends on E major → Bridge begins in C major (G\# as the common note)**  
  * Song Example: *“There, There”* (Radiohead)  
    * Uses a **B major (V in E major)** to pivot into a new section starting in **D major**, using **F\#** as the shared tone.

---

## **3\. Chromatic Mediants (Unexpected Major/Minor Third Shifts)**

* **Method:** A section shifts by a **major or minor third** (e.g., C major → E major or C major → A♭ major).  
* **Effect:** Creates an **otherworldly, cinematic feel**, often used in film scores or progressive rock.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of C Major: **Verse in C Major → Bridge in A♭ Major (chromatic mediant shift)**  
  * Song Example: *“Golden Slumbers”* (The Beatles)  
    * Jumps from **E minor to C major**, a **major third movement** that sounds rich and expansive.

---

## **4\. Dominant-to-Flat Six Substitution (V → ♭VI)**

* **Method:** Instead of resolving **V → I**, the section moves from V to **♭VI**, creating tension before resolving.  
* **Effect:** A **dramatic, unstable transition**, often used in **rock and metal**.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of A Major: **Chorus ends on E (V) → Bridge moves to F (♭VI)**  
  * Song Example: *“Paranoid Android”* (Radiohead)  
    * The **E major (V) does not resolve to A (I), but instead jumps to F major (♭VI)**, producing a jarring shift.

---

## **5\. Neapolitan Sixth (♭II as a Pivot)**

* **Method:** The bridge or chorus pivots to **♭II (Neapolitan chord)** before moving to another key.  
* **Effect:** A **dramatic, classical-sounding shift**, adding **sophisticated harmonic color**.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of G Major: **Verse in G → Bridge starts with A♭ (♭II) before resolving to D (V) and back to G**  
  * Song Example: *“Bohemian Rhapsody”* (Queen)  
    * Uses **Neapolitan chords (♭II)** to shift into different harmonic landscapes.

---

## **6\. Augmented Chord as a Pivot**

* **Method:** The **V+ (augmented dominant)** or a **secondary dominant augmented** leads to an unexpected key.  
* **Effect:** Creates **suspense** and can sound **dreamlike or uneasy**.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of C Major: **Chorus ends on G+ (V+) → Modulates to E Major (♯III)**  
  * Song Example: *“Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds”* (The Beatles)  
    * Uses **augmented chords as pivots** for sudden key shifts.

---

## **7\. Tritone Modulation (♭V Substitution)**

* **Method:** Instead of resolving V → I, the section jumps **a tritone away** to a distantly related key.  
* **Effect:** **Disorienting, jazz-inspired, or psychedelic**.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of D Major: **Chorus ends on A (V) → Bridge starts in E♭ (♭V shift)**  
  * Song Example: *“YYZ”* (Rush)  
    * Moves in **tritone leaps**, making the transitions sound unsettling yet controlled.

---

## **8\. Planing Dominant Seventh Chords**

* **Method:** The section **moves parallel** in **dominant seventh chords** up or down.  
* **Effect:** A **jazz-infused, unstable progression** often used in fusion or prog rock.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of C Major: **C7 → D7 → E7 → Resolves to A minor (vi)**  
  * Song Example: *“Freedom”* (Jimi Hendrix)  
    * **Moves dominant sevenths in parallel**, building tension before dropping into a new section.

---

**9\. Lydian Modulation (I → II instead of V)**

* **Method:** Instead of resolving I → V → I, the song **transitions from I → II** to suggest a Lydian feel.  
* **Effect:** A **bright, floating quality** that feels **open-ended or ethereal**.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of A Major: **Chorus ends on A (I) → Bridge starts on B (II instead of V)**  
  * Song Example: *“Dreams”* (Fleetwood Mac)  
    * The **use of II** instead of the expected **V or vi** gives the progression a **floating quality**.

---

## **10\. Double Chromatic Mediant Shift**

* **Method:** Instead of moving to the expected tonic or dominant, the progression jumps **two chromatic mediant relationships** (e.g., C → E → G\#).  
* **Effect:** Sounds **otherworldly and cinematic**—used in **classical and film scores**.  
* **Example:**  
  * Key of C Major: **Chorus ends on C Major → Bridge starts on E Major → Then moves to A♭ Major**  
  * Song Example: *“Across the Universe”* (The Beatles)  
    * Moves in chromatic mediant relationships to create a **dreamy, flowing transition**.

## **Conclusion**

These uncommon harmonic transitions add **unexpected movement and contrast** to a song. While standard **V → I or IV → I resolutions** work well, these approaches introduce **new harmonic colors** and emotional shifts. Whether it’s **chromatic mediants**, **augmented chords**, or **parallel dominant motion**, these techniques can elevate songwriting beyond conventional progressions.

# 10\. Chord Substitutions: Applications & Explanations

Chord substitutions can make progressions more interesting, add harmonic richness, and allow for smoother voice leading. Below is a list of common chord substitutions categorized by function, along with applications and explanations.

---

## **1\. Diatonic Substitutions**

These substitutions use chords from the same key but replace a chord with another that shares common tones.

### **a) Relative Major/Minor Substitution**

* I ↔ vi (C ↔ Am)  
* ii ↔ IV (Dm ↔ F)  
* iii ↔ V (Em ↔ G)

Application:

* Used to soften progressions while maintaining harmonic function.  
* Example: C \- G \- Am \- F → Am \- G \- C \- F (softer color).

Explanation:

* The relative minor shares 3 common tones with its major counterpart.  
* Works well in ballads and emotional progressions.

---

### 

### 

### 

### **b) Substituting a Major for its Relative Minor**

* IV → ii (F → Dm)  
* V → iii (G → Em)

Application:

* Creates a gentler, jazzier movement in functional harmony.  
* Example: C \- F \- G \- C → C \- Dm \- Em \- C (smoother transition).

Explanation:

* IV (F major) and ii (Dm) share two notes, making the transition more fluid.  
* Common in jazz, neo-soul, and soft rock.

---

## **2\. Dominant Substitutions**

Dominant (V) chords can be replaced with alternatives that maintain their tension and function.

### **a) Secondary Dominants**

* V → V of V (V7/V)  
* Example: C \- G \- C → C \- D7 \- G \- C

Application:

* Used to temporarily tonicize another chord.  
* Example: I \- V \- I can become I \- V7/V \- V \- I for more motion.

Explanation:

* The secondary dominant adds a stronger pull to the next chord.  
* Found in jazz, blues, gospel.

---

### **b) Tritone Substitution**

* V → bII7  
* Example: C \- G7 \- C → C \- Db7 \- C

Application:

* Used in jazz, blues, and funk to add chromatic movement.  
* Example: Instead of G7 (V7), use Db7 (bII7) leading back to C.

Explanation:

* G7 and Db7 share the same tritone (B \- F).  
* This creates a smooth voice-leading alternative.

---

### **c) bVII Substitution (Dominant Borrowing)**

* V → bVII (G → Bb)  
* Example: C \- G \- C → C \- Bb \- C

Application:

* Common in rock, blues, and folk (Mixolydian sound).  
* Example: Sweet Home Alabama (D \- C \- G) uses this idea.

Explanation:

* The bVII (Bb) acts as a dominant substitute without leading-tone tension.  
* Adds a modal, bluesy feel.

---

## 

## 

## **3\. Chromatic & Modal Interchange Substitutions**

These substitutions use chords from parallel minor/major scales to create new colors.

### **a) Borrowing from Parallel Minor**

* IV → iv (F → Fm)  
* I → bIII (C → Eb)  
* V → bVII (G → Bb)

Application:

* Adds melancholy, jazziness, or dramatic tension.  
* Example: C \- F \- G \- C → C \- Fm \- G \- C (darker, jazz-like mood).

Explanation:

* The minor iv (Fm) softens the resolution of F → G.  
* Common in The Beatles, Radiohead, jazz harmony.

---

### **b) Neapolitan Chord (bII)**

* ii → bII (Dm → Db)  
* Example: C \- Dm \- G \- C → C \- Db \- G \- C

Application:

* Used in classical, jazz, and film scoring for tension.  
* Example: Instead of ii (Dm), use Db major for more drama.

Explanation:

* The Neapolitan (bII) is a chromatic pre-dominant that resolves to V.  
* Used by Beethoven, Chopin, Hans Zimmer.

---

### 

### 

### **c) Augmented 6th Chords (Leading to V)**

* IV → Augmented 6th Chord (F → F+6 → G)  
* Example: C \- F \- G \- C → C \- F+6 \- G \- C

Application:

* Used in classical and jazz for stronger motion to V.  
* Example: A♭ (b6) in F+6 leads chromatically to G.

Explanation:

* Contains a tritone pull (A♭ \- B) resolving to G.  
* Common in film music, dramatic cadences.

---

## **4\. Jazz Extensions & Modern Substitutions**

Used in jazz, neo-soul, and gospel for richer harmony.

### **a) Dominant 7th to ii-V-I**

* V → ii \- V (G → Dm \- G)  
* Example: C \- G \- C → C \- Dm7 \- G7 \- C

Application:

* Softens dominant movement in jazz and R\&B.

Explanation:

* ii-V smooths the resolution to I, adding a jazz feel.

---

### 

### **b) Diminished Passing Chords**

* I → I\#dim → ii (C \- C\#dim \- Dm)  
* V → Vdim → I (G \- Gdim \- C)

Application:

* Adds passing chromatic movement.  
* Common in jazz, blues, and Broadway.

Example:

* C \- C\#dim \- Dm \- G \- C → (Chromatic stepwise motion).

Explanation:

* Diminished chords create smooth bass motion and secondary dominant effects.

---

## **5\. Blues & Rock Substitutions**

For gritty, expressive harmonic movement.

### **a) Dominant 7th Substitution**

* I → I7 (C → C7)  
* IV → IV7 (F → F7)

Application:

* Used in blues progressions (e.g., 12-bar blues).

Example:

* C7 \- F7 \- G7 \- C7 → Blues turnarounds.

Explanation:

* The dominant 7th on I and IV adds blues tension.

# 11\. How to Apply Chord Substitutions & Why They Matter

Chord substitutions are used to enhance harmony, create variation, smooth transitions, or add tension and color to progressions. Below are general ways to apply chord substitutions, along with explanations of why you'd use them.

---

## **1\. Functional Substitutions (Maintaining Harmonic Role)**

Why? To vary a progression while keeping the original function intact.

### **a) Substitute a Chord with its Relative Major/Minor**

* I ↔ vi (C ↔ Am)  
* IV ↔ ii (F ↔ Dm)  
* V ↔ iii (G ↔ Em)

How to Apply:

* Instead of I \- IV \- V \- I (C \- F \- G \- C), try:  
  vi \- ii \- V \- I (Am \- Dm \- G \- C)

Why?

* The relative major/minor shares many of the same notes, keeping the progression cohesive.  
* Creates a smoother, softer feel (good for ballads, jazz, and softer genres).

---

### 

### 

### 

### **b) Substitute a Major IV with a Minor iv (Modal Interchange)**

* IV → iv (F → Fm in C Major)

How to Apply:

* Instead of C \- F \- G \- C, try:  
  C \- Fm \- G \- C

Why?

* The minor iv adds a melancholic color, often used in jazz, neo-soul, and film music.  
* Creates a smooth voice-leading motion, especially when leading to V.

---

## **2\. Dominant Substitutions (Enhancing Tension & Resolution)**

Why? To strengthen or soften tension leading to resolution.

### **a) Tritone Substitution (V → bII7)**

* G7 → Db7 in C Major

How to Apply:

* Instead of C \- G7 \- C, try:  
  C \- Db7 \- C

Why?

* The tritone (B-F) in G7 is the same as in Db7, creating a smooth resolution.  
* Used in jazz, blues, and funk for a sophisticated chromatic movement.

---

### **b) Secondary Dominants (Adding Motion)**

* V → V of V (D7 instead of G in C Major)

How to Apply:

* Instead of C \- G \- C, try:  
  C \- D7 \- G \- C

Why?

* Adds stronger motion toward V, making the progression feel more dynamic.  
* Used in classical, jazz, and gospel.

---

## **3\. Chromatic Passing Chords (Smooth Transitions)**

Why? To fill gaps between chords and create movement.

### **a) Diminished Passing Chords**

* I → I\#dim → ii (C \- C\#dim \- Dm)

How to Apply:

* Instead of C \- Dm \- G \- C, try:  
  C \- C\#dim \- Dm \- G \- C

Why?

* The C\#dim chord smoothly connects C and Dm, creating a chromatic leading tone.  
* Adds tension and sophistication (common in jazz, Broadway, and classical).

---

### 

### **b) Neapolitan Chord (bII instead of ii)**

* ii → bII (Dm → Db in C Major)

How to Apply:

* Instead of C \- Dm \- G \- C, try:  
  C \- Db \- G \- C

Why?

* The Neapolitan chord (bII) creates a dramatic pre-dominant.  
* Common in classical and film music.

---

## 

## **4\. Modal & Borrowed Chords (Expanding Color)**

Why? To pull from parallel modes and change the emotional impact.

### **a) Borrowing from Parallel Minor**

* I → bIII (C → Eb)  
* V → bVII (G → Bb)

How to Apply:

* Instead of C \- G \- C, try:  
  C \- Bb \- C

Why?

* The bVII chord (Bb in C major) removes the need for a leading tone.  
* Creates a Mixolydian, bluesy feel, used in rock and folk.

---

### **b) Lydian Substitution (IV → II)**

* IV → II (F → D in C Major)

How to Apply:

* Instead of C \- F \- G \- C, try:  
  C \- D \- G \- C

Why?

* The II chord borrows from the Lydian mode, adding a modern, floating sound.  
* Used in film scores and jazz fusion.

---

## **5\. Jazz & Gospel Extensions**

Why? To add richer, complex harmonic movement.

### **a) Extended Chords Instead of Basic Triads**

* V → V7 (G → G7)  
* IV → IVmaj7 (F → Fmaj7)  
* ii → ii7 (Dm → Dm7)

How to Apply:

* Instead of C \- F \- G \- C, try:  
  Cmaj7 \- Fmaj7 \- G7 \- Cmaj7

Why?

* Adds harmonic depth, making the progression sound more sophisticated and colorful.  
* Essential in jazz, R\&B, and neo-soul.

---

### **b) ii-V-I Substitutions**

* V → ii-V (G → Dm \- G7 in C Major)

How to Apply:

* Instead of C \- G \- C, try:  
  C \- Dm7 \- G7 \- C

Why?

* The ii chord softens the jump to V, creating a smooth jazz-style transition.

---

## 

## **General Application Summary**

| Original Progression | Substituted Progression | Effect |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| I \- IV \- V \- I (C \- F \- G \- C) | vi \- ii \- V \- I (Am \- Dm \- G \- C) | Softer, voice-led motion |
| I \- IV \- V \- I (C \- F \- G \- C) | I \- iv \- V \- I (C \- Fm \- G \- C) | Darker, jazzier feel |
| I \- V \- I (C \- G \- C) | I \- V7/V \- V \- I (C \- D7 \- G \- C) | Stronger motion |
| I \- V \- I (C \- G \- C) | I \- bVII \- I (C \- Bb \- C) | Bluesy, modal feel |
| I \- ii \- V \- I (C \- Dm \- G \- C) | I \- bII \- V \- I (C \- Db \- G \- C) | Dramatic, film-like tension |

---

## 

## **Why Use Substitutions?**

1. To Make a Progression Less Predictable  
   * Instead of I \- IV \- V \- I, using I \- iv \- V \- I makes it sound more interesting.  
2. To Add Tension or Softness  
   * Tritone substitutions (V → bII7) increase tension.  
   * Relative minor substitutions (I → vi) decrease tension.  
3. To Enhance Voice Leading  
   * Using diminished passing chords smooths harmonic movement.  
4. To Create Genre-Specific Sounds  
   * Jazz \= ii-V-I, extended chords.  
   * Rock/Blues \= bVII and Mixolydian movement.  
   * Classical \= Neapolitan (bII) and augmented 6th chords.

# 12.Effective Harmonic Substitutions 

# for Accompaniment & Improvisation

Harmonic substitutions can make accompaniment more interesting and improvised solos more expressive by altering the underlying harmonic framework. Here are some effective substitution techniques, grouped by function.

---

## **1\. Diatonic Substitutions (Smooth & Natural)**

These substitutions keep the harmonic function intact while adding variety.

### **a) Relative Major/Minor Substitution**

* I ↔ vi (C ↔ Am)  
* IV ↔ ii (F ↔ Dm)  
* V ↔ iii (G ↔ Em)

Usage in Accompaniment:

* Creates a smoother, softer harmonic movement.  
* Works well for ballads, jazz, and folk.  
* Example:  
  * Instead of C \- G \- F \- C, try Am \- G \- Dm \- C.

Usage in Improvisation:

* Play major or minor pentatonic scales over substituted chords.  
* Over I → vi (C → Am), try switching between C major pentatonic and A minor pentatonic for a smoother, bluesy feel.

---

### 

### **b) Major IV → Minor iv (Modal Interchange)**

* IV → iv (F → Fm in C major)

Usage in Accompaniment:

* Adds a melancholic, jazz-like color.  
* Example: Instead of C \- F \- G \- C, try C \- Fm \- G \- C.

Usage in Improvisation:

* Over Fm, play C Dorian (C \- D \- Eb \- F \- G \- A \- Bb) to highlight the modal shift.

---

## **2\. Dominant Substitutions (More Motion & Color)**

These substitutions affect V (dominant) chords, altering tension and resolution.

### **a) Secondary Dominants (V of V)**

* V → V7/V (G → D7 → G in C major)

Usage in Accompaniment:

* Adds stronger pull toward the resolution.  
* Example: Instead of C \- G \- C, try C \- D7 \- G \- C.

Usage in Improvisation:

* Over D7 (V7/V), emphasize F\# (leading tone of G) to create a stronger resoluti

---

### 

### **b) Tritone Substitution (V → bII7)**

* V7 → bII7 (G7 → Db7 in C major)

Usage in Accompaniment:

* Adds chromatic movement and jazz sophistication.  
* Example: Instead of C \- G7 \- C, try C \- Db7 \- C.

Usage in Improvisation:

* Over Db7, play a whole-tone scale (Db \- Eb \- F \- G \- A \- B) for a modern jazz feel.

---

## **3\. Chromatic Passing Chords (Smooth Connections)**

These substitutions help connect chords chromatically.

### **a) Diminished Passing Chords**

* I → I\#dim → ii (C \- C\#dim \- Dm)

Usage in Accompaniment:

* Smoothly connects I and ii (or other diatonic chords).  
* Example: Instead of C \- Dm \- G \- C, try C \- C\#dim \- Dm \- G \- C.

Usage in Improvisation:

* Over C\#dim, use an arpeggio (C\# \- E \- G \- A\#) to highlight the diminished color

### 

### **b) Neapolitan Chord (bII Instead of ii)**

* ii → bII (Dm → Db in C major)

Usage in Accompaniment:

* Adds drama and classical color.  
* Example: Instead of C \- Dm \- G \- C, try C \- Db \- G \- C.

Usage in Improvisation:

* Over Db, try a Phrygian dominant scale (Db \- Eb \- F \- Gb \- Ab \- B \- C) for a darker, Spanish-like sound.

---

## **4\. Modal & Borrowed Chords (Expanding Color)**

These substitutions bring in chords from parallel modes.

### **a) Borrowed Chords from Parallel Minor**

* I → bIII (C → Eb)  
* V → bVII (G → Bb)

Usage in Accompaniment:

* Creates bluesy, folk, or rock flavors.  
* Example: Instead of C \- G \- C, try C \- Bb \- C.

Usage in Improvisation:

* Over Bb, try a Mixolydian scale (C \- D \- E \- F \- G \- A \- Bb).

---

### **b) Lydian Substitution (IV → II)**

* IV → II (F → D in C major)

Usage in Accompaniment:

* Adds a modern, ethereal touch.  
* Example: Instead of C \- F \- G \- C, try C \- D \- G \- C.

Usage in Improvisation:

* Over D major, use the Lydian dominant scale (D \- E \- F\# \- G\# \- A \- B \- C).

---

## **5\. Jazz & Gospel Extensions**

These substitutions add richer, extended harmony.

### **a) Extended Chords Instead of Basic Triads**

* V → V7 (G → G7)  
* IV → IVmaj7 (F → Fmaj7)  
* ii → ii7 (Dm → Dm7)

Usage in Accompaniment:

* Adds sophisticated voice-leading and richer sound.  
* Example: Instead of C \- F \- G \- C, try Cmaj7 \- Fmaj7 \- G7 \- Cmaj7.

Usage in Improvisation:

* Over maj7 chords, use an arpeggio-based approach emphasizing 7th and 9th tones.

---

### **b) ii-V-I Variations**

* V → ii \- V (G → Dm \- G)

Usage in Accompaniment:

* Softens the jump to V, creating a jazz transition.  
* Example: Instead of C \- G \- C, try C \- Dm7 \- G7 \- C.

Usage in Improvisation:

* Over Dm7 \- G7 \- C, use a Bebop scale (C \- D \- E \- F \- G \- A \- Bb \- B \- C) for smooth phrasing.
